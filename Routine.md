# THE PHAT WORKOUT
Basically the principle behind the phat routine is that you have days where you focus on POWER and days where you focus on HYPERTROPHY. 

This in theory will get you solid gains in both strength and size. 
## Notation
When describing sets and reps I will use the following format:

sets x reps
