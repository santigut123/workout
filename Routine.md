# THE PHAT WORKOUT
Basically the principle behind the phat routine is that you have days where you focus on POWER and days where you focus on HYPERTROPHY. 

This in theory will get you solid gains in both strength and size. 
## Notation
When describing sets and reps I will use the following format:

*sets x reps*

## Note
You can reduce amount of sets to 3 if you need to be quick or are really tired or something




## THE ROUTINE

### Day 1: Upper Power
#### Bench Press (With Bar) 4x(3-5)
#### Pull Ups (Assisted until swole) 4x(6-8)
#### Rows(Choose your style) 4x(6-8)
You can choose between the following:
1. Sitting Row
2. Pendlay Row
3. T-Bar Row

#### Curls 3x(6-8)
My fav curl style is the preacher curl, with both arms propped up. But standing is fine, just make sure your arms are close to your body.

#### Horizontal Rows 3x(6-10)
#### Overhead Shoulder Press with Dumbells 4x(5-8) 






2. 
### Day 2: Lower Power
#### Squats 4x(3-4)
Tips:
1. *DONT DO BUTT WINK ;)*

#### Leg Press 4x(5-6)
Tips:
1. When you are on the extension part of the movement, do not fully extend so your knees are indented. 
#### Leg Curls 3x(5-6)
#### Leg Extentions 3x(5-6)
#### Calve Raises(standing or sitting) 4x(6-8)

Day 3: Rest
### Day 4: Back and Shoulders Hypertrophy
#### Lat Pulldown 4x(8-12)
#### Seated Cable Rows 4x(8-12)
#### Horizontal Row  3x(6-10) alt (Tbar Rows)
This one is hard, you might need to work more with the seated cable rows and the TBar rows before you can do it effectively. 
#### Shrugs 4x(10-12)
#### Sitting Shoulder Press Dumbells 4x(8-12)
Keep the dumbells in front of your face at all times.



### Day 5: Leg Hypertrophy
Just a note, this routine is basically the same as the lower body power, just more reps per set.

#### Squats 4x(6-10)
Tips:
1. *DONT DO BUTT WINK ;)*
