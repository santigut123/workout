# THE PHAT WORKOUT
Basically the principle behind the phat routine is that you have days where you focus on POWER and days where you focus on HYPERTROPHY. 

This in theory will get you solid gains in both strength and size. 
## Notation
When describing sets and reps I will use the following format:

*sets x reps*


## THE ROUTINE

### Day 1: Upper Power
#### Bench Press (With Bar) 4x(3-5)
#### Pull Ups (Assisted until swole) 4x(6-8)
#### Rows(Choose your style) 4x(6-8)
You can choose between the following:
1. Sitting Row
2. Pendlay Row
3. T-Bar Row

#### Curls 3x(6-8)
My fav curl style is the preacher curl, with both arms propped up. But standing is fine, just make sure your arms are close to your body.

#### Horizontal Rows 3x(6-10)
#### Overhead Shoulder Press with Dumbells 4x(5-8) 






2. 
### Day 2: Lower Power

#### Leg Curls 3x(5-6)
#### Leg Extentions 3x(5-6)
#### Calve Raises(standing or sitting) 4x(6-8)

Day 3: Rest
